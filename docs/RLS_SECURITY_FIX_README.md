# RLS Security Fix - Step by Step Guide

## üö® CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE
Your database has Row Level Security (RLS) disabled on all public tables. This means anyone with API access can read/modify all your data.

## üìã WHAT I'VE CREATED FOR YOU

### 1. SQL Script: `sql/enable_rls_security.sql`
- Enables RLS on all tables mentioned in the security report
- Creates security policies based on user roles (Admin, Manager, Sales)
- Protects sensitive data with appropriate access controls

### 2. Django Management Command: `enable_rls_security.py`
- Automatically applies the SQL script
- Includes safety checks and dry-run option
- Provides detailed feedback on what's being changed

## üõ†Ô∏è HOW TO APPLY THE FIX

### Option 1: Using Django Management Command (Recommended)
```bash
# Test what would be changed (safe to run)
python manage.py enable_rls_security --dry-run

# Apply the security fix
python manage.py enable_rls_security
```

### Option 2: Direct SQL in Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Click on "SQL Editor" 
3. Open the file `sql/enable_rls_security.sql`
4. Copy and paste the contents into the SQL editor
5. Click "Run" to execute

## üîê SECURITY POLICIES CREATED

### User Roles Expected:
- **Admin**: Full access to all data
- **Manager**: Business operations (sales, reports, accounting)
- **Sales**: Sales operations (invoices, customers)

### Access Rules:
- **System Tables** (auth_*, django_*): Admin only
- **Sales Data** (invoices, products): All authenticated users can read, Sales+ can modify  
- **Accounting Data**: Manager+ access only
- **Audit Logs**: Manager+ can read

## ‚ö†Ô∏è BEFORE YOU RUN THIS

1. **Create User Groups** in Django Admin:
   - Admin
   - Manager  
   - Sales

2. **Assign Users to Groups** based on their roles

3. **Backup Your Database** (recommended)

## üß™ TESTING AFTER APPLYING

1. Test login with different user types
2. Verify each role can access appropriate data
3. Confirm restricted data is properly blocked
4. Check that your app functionality still works

## üÜò IF SOMETHING BREAKS

The policies are designed to be permissive for business operations while blocking unauthorized access. If you have issues:

1. Check user group assignments
2. Verify users are in the correct groups
3. Look for policy conflicts in application logs
4. Contact me for adjustments to specific policies

## üìû SUPPORT
