### **Before Integration**
❌ Cash department revenue was ignored in accounting  
❌ No visibility into cash vs regular sales performance  
❌ Manual tracking of subscriber withdrawal patterns  
❌ No comprehensive cross-department reporting  

### **After Integration**
✅ **Complete Financial Picture**: All revenue sources tracked and reported  
✅ **Department Performance Insights**: Clear visibility into which department drives more profit  
✅ **Service Optimization**: Understand which cash services are most profitable  
✅ **Staff Performance**: Track performance across different types of sales

## 🎉 **Ready for Use**

The system is now ready to provide comprehensive accounting and analytics across both departments while maintaining their operational differences. The cash department continues to operate with its rate-based, immediate-payment model, while regular sales maintain inventory tracking and payment status management.

All data is properly integrated for unified reporting while keeping department-specific analytics separate for operational insights.
