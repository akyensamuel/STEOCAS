# Production Database Connection Fix - Round 2
# ==========================================

## Issue Reoccurrence
The `customer_phone` column error has returned in production, indicating that the database connection cache needs to be refreshed again.

## Error Details
```
psycopg2.errors.UndefinedColumn: column sales_app_invoice.customer_phone does not exist
```

## Root Cause
Production database connection pooling is caching old schema information even after successful manual restarts.

## Solution Applied
1. Force new deployment via Git commit
2. This will trigger fresh database connections
3. Clear any remaining connection cache issues
