# Cash Department Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a separate cash department with rate-based pricing system alongside the existing regular sales system. The cash department handles transactions where pricing is calculated as **Rate × Amount = Total**.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. **Separate Products Page for Cash Department**
- **Location**: `/sales/cash/products/`
- **Features**:
  - Add/Edit/Delete cash products with rate-based pricing
  - Modal-based interface for product management
  - Special indicator for "SUBSCRIBER WITHDRAWAL" products
  - Rate field accepts decimal values up to 4 places (0.0001)

### 2. **Cash Sales Entry Page**
- **Location**: `/sales/cash/sales_entry/`
- **Features**:
  - Same autofill implementation as regular sales entry
  - **Wide items field** (w-96 class) for better usability
  - Amount-based pricing instead of unit price × quantity
  - Rate auto-populated from product selection
  - **No balance field** - cash transactions are always paid in full
  - Auto-saves form data to localStorage
  - Real-time total calculation

### 3. **Special SUBSCRIBER WITHDRAWAL Logic**
- **Rule**: 
  - When amount ≥ 6000: Rate = 0.001
  - When amount < 6000: Rate = 0 (no charge)
- **Implementation**: 
  - Handled in both model save method and JavaScript
  - Visual indicator on products page
  - Special note on receipts showing whether charge applies

### 4. **Rate-Based Pricing System**
- **Formula**: Total = Rate × Amount
- **Example**: 
  - Amount: 10,000
  - Rate: 0.01
  - Total: 100.00

### 5. **Wide Items Field**
- **Regular Sales Entry**: Updated to use `px-6 py-2` and `w-96` class for items column
- **Cash Sales Entry**: Items field takes more horizontal space for better product name visibility

### 6. **Database Models Added**
```python
class CashProduct(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    rate = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=4)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

class CashInvoice(models.Model):
    invoice_no = models.CharField(max_length=20, unique=True)
    customer_name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    customer_phone = models.CharField(max_length=20)
    date_of_sale = models.DateField(default=timezone.now)
    notes = models.TextField(blank=True)
    total = models.DecimalField(max_digits=12, decimal_places=2)
    payment_status = models.CharField(choices=[('paid', 'Paid'), ('cancelled', 'Cancelled')])
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.SET_NULL)

class CashSale(models.Model):
    invoice = models.ForeignKey('CashInvoice', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    item = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    amount = models.DecimalField(max_digits=12, decimal_places=2)
    rate = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=4)
    total_price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=12, decimal_places=2)
```

### 7. **Navigation Integration**
- Added **Cash Dept** dropdown in navbar for managers

### 8. **Print Functionality**

## 🎯 Key Differences from Regular Sales

| Feature | Regular Sales | Cash Department |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Pricing** | Unit Price × Quantity | Rate × Amount |
| **Balance** | Tracks balance due | No balance (always paid) |
| **Stock** | Tracks inventory | No stock tracking |
| **Invoice Prefix** | INV-YYYYMMDD-### | CASH-YYYYMMDD-### |
| **Payment Status** | Multiple statuses | Always "paid" or "cancelled" |
| **Items Field** | Standard width | **Wide width (w-96)** |

## 🔄 Special Business Rules

### SUBSCRIBER WITHDRAWAL Rule
```javascript
if (selectedProduct === 'SUBSCRIBER WITHDRAWAL') {
    if (amount >= 6000) {
        rate = 0.001;
        total = amount × 0.001;
    } else {
        rate = 0;
        total = 0; // No charge
    }
} else {
    total = amount × normalRate;
}
```

### Auto-calculation Flow
1. User selects product → Rate auto-fills
2. User enters amount → Total calculates in real-time
3. Special SUBSCRIBER WITHDRAWAL rule applies if conditions met
4. Grand total updates automatically

## 🧪 Testing Features

### Sample Products Created
1. **SUBSCRIBER WITHDRAWAL** - Rate: 0 (special logic: 0.001 for amounts ≥ 6000, otherwise 0)
2. **MONEY TRANSFER** - Rate: 0.01
3. **BILL PAYMENT** - Rate: 0.02 
4. **CASH DEPOSIT** - Rate: 0.001
5. **ACCOUNT OPENING** - Rate: 1.0

5. **Print receipt**: Verify all information displays correctly
