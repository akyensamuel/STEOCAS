## 🔍 LEGITIMATE "CASH" REFERENCES (DO NOT REMOVE)

These are standard business/accounting features unrelated to the cash department system:

### 1. Payment Method Options
**Location:** `accounting_app/models.py`
```python
PAYMENT_METHODS = [
    ('cash', 'Cash'),  # ← Payment type, not cash department
    ('card', 'Credit/Debit Card'),
    ('bank', 'Bank Transfer'),
    ('cheque', 'Cheque'),
    ('other', 'Other')
]
```
**Purpose:** Track how expenses were paid  
**Status:** ✅ Keep

### 2. User Group References
**Location:** `accounting_app/analytics.py`
```python
cashiers_group = Group.objects.get(name='Cashiers')
```
**Purpose:** Staff performance analytics for Cashiers user role  
**Status:** ✅ Keep (Cashiers work on regular sales)

### 3. UI Descriptive Text
**Location:** `accounting_app/templates/accounting_app/dashboard.html`
```html
<p>Manager & cashier rankings</p>
```
**Purpose:** Describes staff performance section  
**Status:** ✅ Keep (Refers to user roles)
