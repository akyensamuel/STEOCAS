## 🔍 Remaining Cash References (Not Cash Department)

### Legitimate References (DO NOT REMOVE):
These are standard accounting features unrelated to the cash department:

1. **Payment Methods** (`accounting_app/models.py`):
   - `('cash', 'Cash')` - Payment method choice for expenses
   - Used for tracking how expenses were paid (cash vs card vs bank transfer)
   - **Status:** Keep - This is normal accounting functionality

2. **User Group References** (`accounting_app/analytics.py`):
   - References to `Cashiers` user group for staff performance tracking
   - **Status:** Keep - Cashiers are a legitimate user role

3. **Dashboard Text** (`accounting_app/templates/accounting_app/dashboard.html`):
   - "Manager & cashier rankings" - descriptive text
   - **Status:** Keep - Refers to user roles, not cash department

4. **Migration History** (`accounting_app/migrations/0002_*.py`):
   - Contains historical payment method choices including 'cash'
   - **Status:** Keep - Historical data, cannot be changed
